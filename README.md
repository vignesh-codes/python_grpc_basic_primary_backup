# Primary-Backup Replication System with gRPC  

## üìå Project Overview  
This project implements a **Primary-Backup Replication System** using **gRPC in Python**.  
It ensures **data consistency** by forwarding client requests to multiple backups and committing data only if at least one backup acknowledges the write.  
Additionally, a **heartbeat service** monitors the availability of the primary and backups.

## üîß Setup & Installation  

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Install Dependencies**  
Ensure you have Python **3.8+** installed, then install the required packages:  
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Generate gRPC Code from .proto Files
Run the following commands to generate Python gRPC files:

```sh
python -m grpc_tools.protoc -I=. --python_out=. --grpc_python_out=. replication.proto
python -m grpc_tools.protoc -I=. --python_out=. --grpc_python_out=. heartbeat_service.proto
```


# üöÄ Running the System
### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Start the Heartbeat Service
This monitors the primary and backups for failures:

```sh
python heartbeat_service.py # Runs on port 50053
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Start Backup Servers
Run two separate backup instances:

```
python backup.py   # Runs on port 50052 (backup1)
python backup2.py  # Runs on port 50050 (backup2)
```
### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Start the Primary Server
```
python primary.py  # Runs on port 50051
```
### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Run the Client
The client sends key-value writes to the primary:
```
python client.py
```

Example input:
```
Enter key: 1  
Enter value: book  
```
Expected output:
```
Response from primary: Write successful
```
### üõ† How It Works
‚úÖ The client sends a key-value request to the primary.
‚úÖ The primary forwards the request to both backups (backup.py & backup2.py).
‚úÖ The primary commits the write only if at least one backup acknowledges it.
‚úÖ The heartbeat service detects failures if any server stops sending heartbeats.

### üìú Failure Handling
1Ô∏è‚É£ If a backup fails, the primary still commits if at least one backup is alive.
2Ô∏è‚É£ If the primary fails, backups continue running, but client writes will be lost until it restarts.
3Ô∏è‚É£ The heartbeat service logs failures in heartbeat.txt and prints warnings.

### üìÑ Log Files

client.txt ->   Stores client write requests
primary.txt ->	Stores committed writes by primary
backup.txt ->	Stores received writes by backup1
backup2.txt ->	Stores received writes by backup2
heartbeat.txt ->  Tracks alive/down services

### üí° Example heartbeat.txt Log
```
primary is alive. Latest heartbeat received at Wed Mar 05 12:30:00 2025
backup1 is alive. Latest heartbeat received at Wed Mar 05 12:30:05 2025
backup2 is alive. Latest heartbeat received at Wed Mar 05 12:30:10 2025
‚ö†Ô∏è primary might be down! No heartbeat received since Wed Mar 05 12:30:00 2025
```
# ‚ùå Simulating Failures
### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Kill the Primary
Stop primary.py using CTRL+C. You should see in heartbeat.txt:
```
‚ö†Ô∏è primary might be down! No heartbeat received since Wed Mar 05 12:30:00 2025
```
### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Kill One Backup
Stop backup.py using CTRL+C. If the second backup is still running, writes will continue.
If both backups fail, the primary will not commit writes.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Restart Servers
To recover from failure, restart any failed component using:

```
python primary.py
python backup.py
python backup2.py
```
Heartbeats will resume, and heartbeat.txt will update.
